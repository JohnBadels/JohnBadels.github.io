# Hello! I'm Gideon.

I am an undergraduate student taking up Bachelor of Science in Computer Science majoring in Network and Information Security from De La Salle University, with a keen interest in analyzing and addressing potential vulnerabilities in digital systems. I enjoy identifying risks, understanding patterns in network behavior, and applying critical thinking to develop robust security measures. I have hands-on experience in cybersecurity and forensics, focusing on improving the safety of information systems. I work methodically to spot and fix security risks, helping make systems more secure and reliable.
